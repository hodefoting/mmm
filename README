mmm - memory mapped machine

mmm is a C library API providing access to virtual input, graphics and
audio through a shared memoty (mmaped file) interface.

mmm uses a client/host model, where the environment specific (SDL / linux
framebuffer / other) host environment runs in a separate process from the
client process. The host and client communicate through a single memory
mapped file in this directory. The client is responsible for creating, and
growing, the file. While the host is responsible for deleting the file.

If no host exists (MMVM_PATH environment variable is set), libmmm will try to
spawn a single-client host for the current runtime environment.

The client doesn't have to use mmap, in-place binary manipulation on a
file with seek and write should work just as well. The memory mapped
implementation does however allow for a highly efficient transparent
method.

Interfaces implemented:

resizable 32bit/pixel framebuffer
pcm data output
event input stream
  keyboard / mouse input
message output stream

look in examples/nano-text.c for example on how client use of mmm is intended.
